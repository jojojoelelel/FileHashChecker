1. Create a simple backend script in Python to process 2 files sent in and get their checksum.
2. Expose it through an API module with Flask.
3. Simple frontend site using React, Typescript and antdesign coponents that takes in two files.
4. Dockerize all the modules above (1 for React, 1 for API, 1 for backend module).
5. Use Docker Compose to define and run these Docker containers.
6. FOr communication between Docker containers, you may consider two approaches.
	a. Approach 1: Make use of zeroMQ, or a similar messaging queue library
	b. Approach 2 : Put the containers in the same network and expose the relevant ports to each container for them to communicate with each other.
7. Return the resultant checksums and a Boolean to indicate whether the files are the same or not onto the frontend.
